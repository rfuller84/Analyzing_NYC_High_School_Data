# Analyzing NYC High School Data

In this project, we will analyze data from high schools in New York City. We will explore standardized test scores, school demographics, 
and surveys given to parents, teachers, and students to look for connections. Communities across the United States want their children 
to have access to great schools and there is much debate about what makes for great schools and what steps should be taken to ensure 
more children have access to them.

By taking a deep dive into the datasets curated by the city of New York, we may be able to uncover interesting trends of schools that 
are getting great results. We will use a variety of mathematical and visual strategies to illustrate patterns in the data. Our analysis may confirm popular beliefs about the state of our schools and they may provide new insights that raise more questions to be explored.

## Questions to explore

- How are schools with higher SAT scores different than other schools?
- How do the schools in different boroughs differ from each other?
- How do schools with high percentage of free and reduced lunch students differ from other schools?
- How do schools with different graduation rates differ from each other?
- How does the demographic of students a school serves impact its outcomes?
- Are graduation rates higher when students feel safe and respected?
- Does it matter what extracurricular activities a school offers?
